# Music-Store-Database-Analysis-SQL-Project-
This project contains a collection of SQL queries designed to analyze a music store database. The queries are divided into three levels — Easy, Moderate, and Advanced — to explore insights such as customer behavior, sales trends, and most popular artists/genres.

📂 Project Structure

Question Set 1 – Easy
Basic queries using SELECT, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY.
Examples:

Find the senior-most employee.

Countries with the most invoices.

Top 3 invoice totals.

Question Set 2 – Moderate
Joins and filtering with subqueries.
Examples:

List of all Rock music listeners.

Top 10 artists with the most Rock tracks.

Tracks longer than average duration.

Question Set 3 – Advanced
Complex queries using CTEs, Window Functions, and Recursive Queries.
Examples:

Best customer for the best-selling artist.

Most popular genre per country.

Top-spending customer per country.
